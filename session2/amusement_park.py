    Suppose you are working for an amusement park company and you need to write a program
    that checks that the client’s age is greater than 14 to make sure that it will be safe
    for them to be on a particular attraction.
    Write a program that outputs “YES” if the client’s age is greater than 14 and 
    “NO” if the client’s age is less than or equal to 14. 
    If the age entered is invalid, i.e the number is less than zero notify the user about by printing “ERROR”
